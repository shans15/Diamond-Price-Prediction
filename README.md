# Diamond-Price-Prediction
Author - Sarthak Hans

## Description:
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as Carat Weight, Cut, Color, Clarity, Polish, Symmetry, and Report. It explores different data analysis and modeling techniques including linear regression and neural networks to develop the prediction model.

## Features:

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing

1. Importing necessary libraries.
2. Reading the dataset from an Excel file.
3. Handling missing values.
4. Descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the dataset.

### Correlation Analysis
1. Calculating the correlation between different variables.
2. Scatter plot to visualize the correlation between Carat Weight and Price.

### Group Means and Boxplots
1. Calculating group means for different categorical variables.
2. Creating boxplots to visualize the distribution of Price across different categories.

### Linear Regression Model
1. Building a linear regression model to predict the Price of diamonds based on different features.
2. Summary statistics to understand the significance of variables.

### Model Performance Evaluation
1. Calculating Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for training and testing data.

### Predicting and Recommending Diamonds
1. Recommending a diamond based on specific criteria.
2. Filtering and sorting the dataset to find the recommended diamond.

### Neural Network Model
1. Building a neural network model for predicting the Price of diamonds.
2. Evaluating the performance of the neural network model using MAPE.

### Affordable Diamond Recommendation
1. Recommending an affordable diamond based on the predicted prices from the neural network model.
